# SYSTEM REQUIREMENT

The codes have been tested on Mathworks Matlab R2017b - R2019b.
Any operating systems that are compatible with above MATLAB versions should be used.

# INSTALLATION GUIDE

Place all the files in the same folder and assign the folder as "the current folder" in MATLAB

# DEMO

The MNIST database is included in the respository.
The training results will be graphically displayed on screen promptly.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the script "ex_situ_cnn_training.m" to train the convolutional nerual network.
2. (Optional) run script "ex_situ_cnn_test.m" after the training to classfy images in MNIST test set.
