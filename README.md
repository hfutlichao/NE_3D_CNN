# SYSTEM REQUIREMENT

The codes have been tested on Mathworks Matlab R2017b - R2019b.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the script "ex_situ_cnn_training.m" to train the convolutional nerual network.
2. (Optional) run script "ex_situ_cnn_test.m" after the training to classfy images in MNIST test set.
3. The codes that interface the hardware is not provided.
